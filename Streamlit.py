Angina plays a crucial role in identifying coronary disease which makes it worthwhile to consider it a separate category for analysis.[1 represents Yes and 0 represents No]')

When a person exercises, their heart works harder to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients. In some cases, if the blood supply to the heart is reduced or blocked, this can result in a decrease in oxygen delivery to the heart muscle, which can be seen on the ECG as ST segment depression.')
